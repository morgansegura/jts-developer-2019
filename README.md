<b>By the end of this course you will have a fully functioning image recognition app to show off on your portfolio. More importantly, you will be able to implement and add the below skillsets to your resume, impress your boss, and ace your next interview</b> (Trust me, some of these may not mean anything to you now, but they are topics that ALL Senior Developers know). You will be taken from absolute zero to knowing how to:

- <b>Use React and Redux</b> to build complex and large applications.

- <b>Improve performance of any web application</b> (Code Splitting, Load Balancing, Caching, Code Optimizations, and much more)

- <b>Use SSH</b> on a remote linux server and generate ssh keys

- <b>Use Webpack 4</b> and <b>Parcel</b> to set up a project and bundle your files

- <b>Implement proper security</b> and securing your apps like an expert

- <b>Use AWS Lambda and Serverless</b> architecture to manage applications that can handle millions of users

- <b>Use Typescript</b> on a project to have less bugs in your code

- <b>Write all kinds of tests and learn about all the testing tools you can use</b> to write better software

- <b>Use Docker and docker compose</b> to create containers for your services

- <b>Use Sessions and JWT</b> to manage user authentication and authorization

- <b>Use Redis database</b> for session management and caching

- <b>Decide when to use Server Side Rendering vs Client Side Rendering</b> for your projects

- <b>Create a Progressive Web App</b> that works offline like a native mobile app.

- <b>Implement Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment</b> for your company and make your boss happy.

The above skillsets are exactly what Senior Developers know and can use in terms of their technical skills. Not only will you understand how to do these things, but most importantly, you will deeply understand why they exist and what problems they solve so that when asked in an interview, you can speak intelligently about them, or when asked by your boss, you can take the lead on the project and implement them.

<b>Here is what sets this course apart from the rest:</b>

1. There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies that a lot of courses online use. Although still useful, outdated technologies are low paying and demand for them is decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include <b>tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc… It’s geared specifically for people that want to excel in their career as a web developer in 2019</b>.

2. After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for intermediate to senior developer roles. You will no longer be a junior developer. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course. <b>You will be taken through everything I have learned over the many years coding while managing projects and people for some of the largest tech firms</b>.

3. This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech consulting companies in Canada. <b>I have built large scale applications, managed projects and people, but most importantly, I have worked directly with these technologies. I am not an online marketer or a salesman. I am a senior software developer who loves programming and believes that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable modern skills</b>.

4. Your time is valuable. You want a course that outlines the best way to learn the topic, in simple and well explained way, so that you fully understand the content instead of just watching somebody on your screen code. <b>I have taken the best pieces, the best methods, from experience as well as from other experts, and condensed everything so that you can learn in the most efficient way possible. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics</b>.

5. <b>We have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself</b>s. You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source. Anytime you have a question you can ask in the chat and someone will surely be able to help you right away including myself.

6. The course is designed to <b>level up your skills ABOVE a Junior Developer role</b>. My previous course The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery is the highest rated developer course on Udemy, and one of the fastest growing. I've <b>helped students who now work at some of the largest tech firms in the world as developers</b>.

In this course, you will be taken through online videos and exercises. It will follow a storyline where you are hired by Keiko Corp. They are a fast growing tech company that has two products which definitely need some work. Each section of the course will solve different problems for this company which mimic real life scenarios you will encounter as a senior developer.

You will become comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put these on your resume:

- Webpack4 + Parcel

- Node.js + Express
